# Python - Alien Invasion game

In Alien Invasion, the player controls a rocket ship that is located on the bottom of the screen. The player can move the ship left and right using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the spacebar. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky and moves both across and down the screen. The player's goal is to shoot down and destroy the aliens. If the player shoots down all the aliens, a new fleet appears that moves faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits the player's ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a ship. If the player loses three ships, the game ends.
